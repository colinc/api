<header>API Reference</header>

# Introduction

All the REST API calls should be POST HTTP requests server-side. This request cannot be initiated on the web client using AJAX approaches.

## Endpoint

`<%= config[:api_host] %>`

<aside class="notice">You must use HTTPS, otherwise you will get a 302 redirect response code</aside>

## Common Parameters

The following are common parameters that should be included in each REST API request

Arguments | &nbsp;
-------- | -------- 
api_key **required** | API Key
api_secret **required** | API Secret
data_type *optional* | The type of data that you're expecting back from the server `JSON` or `XML` *Default: JSON*

## Error Handle

> Example Error Response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 102,
    "message": "You app key and secret doesn't match."
  }
}
```

When getting a response from the server, you should first check the response body for the "error" section. The "error" section indicates this is a failed request, and then you can get the failed code and message from this section.
